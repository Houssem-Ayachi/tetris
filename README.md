What is this project?
--> As the title says this is my personal attempt at creating tetris, it does not have that many features.
    I was more focused on implementing the logic and the mechanics of this game and that I believe I did.

How to run?
--> The .ts files are all compiled, you can change some stuff and recompile them
--> host the index.html page on localhost to play.
